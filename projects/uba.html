            During my time as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Buenos Aires, I played an active role in the academic development of students in introductory computing courses. 
            My responsibilities extended beyond technical instruction to include meaningful human engagement and mentorship.

                This experience significantly enhanced my communication and leadership skills. I learned how to adapt complex technical topics to diverse learning styles, foster group discussion, and support students both academically and personally. 
                It reinforced my belief that teaching is a two-way process—one that cultivates empathy, patience, and a deep understanding of human connection in technical environments.
